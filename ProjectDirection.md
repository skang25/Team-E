## Scenarios

### Scenario 1:

Samuel, a hard-working, full-time software programmer at a big corporation in downtown Chicago finally got his vacation days after working there for a couple years. However, he is working with a tight schedule so he has to catch a flight right after his work on friday. He’s stuck on what he’s going to do about his 2 dogs at home since he won’t be able to stop at home. Until, he downloads the pet caring app and goes through a security process, enters his location, the amount of time he will be gone for, and what kind of pet or how many pets he has that are in need of caring. It will send the status of what the pet caretaker is doing such as feeding, walking, and washing the pet. Now, he can safely travel with his friends without worrying about his pets being lonely and starving at home.

### Scenario 2:

Jason and Hannah are a married 40 year old couple. They work full time and often overtime hours, from the Naperville area. Have two dogs at home, who get stressed out being alone and need to be walked and fed during the day. When the owners come home, their pets are visibly sad. Since the dogs need to be let out during the day and nobody is able to do so, they usually pee at home. This ruined some of the furniture because of which Jason and Hannah decided to look for pet sitters. When they searched the App Store, they found an app that had many great reviews. After doing more research on it, they were pleased. The service provided exactly what they were looking for. They would get assigned a pet sitter, who would come to their house on specified days and time, taking care of their dogs. The safety and security of the service ensured them that this is a great choice for them. Now, the couple don’t stress out about working long hours because they know that their loved dogs are happy.
